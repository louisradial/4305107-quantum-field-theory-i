\begin{problem}{Gauge invariance of the Compton scattering amplitude}{p5}
   The lowest order contribution to the process in the previous problem possesses two contributions \(\mathcal{M} = \mathcal{M}_1 + \mathcal{M}_2.\) 
   \begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
      \item Show that the scattering amplitude \(\mathcal{M}_1\) is not gauge invariant, that is, it changes when we change \(\epsilon_\mu(k) \to \epsilon_\mu(k) + \lambda k_\mu\) for both photons.
      \item Repeat the previous item for \(\mathcal{M}_2.\)
      \item Show that \(\mathcal{M}\) is gauge invariant.
   \end{enumerate}
\end{problem}
