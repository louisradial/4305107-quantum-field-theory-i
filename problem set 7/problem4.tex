\begin{problem}{Differential cross section for elastic scattering in the Yukawa model}{p4}
    For the Yukawa model, evaluate the differential cross section in the lowest nonvanishing order for the elastic scattering of two fermions
    \begin{equation*}
        f_1 + f_2 \to f_3 + f_4
    \end{equation*}
    in the center of mass frame. Consider unpolarized beams and sum over the final state spins. Express the answer in terms of Mandelstam variables.
