\begin{problem}{}{p2}
   Consider the Dirac equation for massless particles, \(i \slashed{\partial} \Psi = 0.\)
   \begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
      \item Show that the operators \(P_R = \frac{1 + \gamma^5}{2}\) and \(P_L = \frac{1 - \gamma^5}{2}\) are orthogonal projectors. Note that \(P_R + P_L = 1.\)
      \item Show  for massless Dirac spinors that the eigenstates of helicity are also eigenstates of chirality, i.e., \(\gamma^5\). Do this for the positive and negative eigenstates of the Hamiltonian.
      \item Show that for any Dirac spinor \(\Psi\) (possibly massive) the following spinors are eigenstates of chirality: \(\Psi_{L,R} = P_{L,R} \Psi.\)
      \item Write the Dirac equation in terms of \(\Psi_{L,R}.\)
      \item How do \(\Psi_{L,R}\) transform under \(C,\) \(P,\) and \(T?\)
      \item Show that the Dirac Lagrangian density for a massless particle is invariant under the chiral transformation \(U = \exp(-i \alpha \gamma^5)\). What is the conserved current associated to this symmetry? Is this true if the particle has a mass \(m?\)
