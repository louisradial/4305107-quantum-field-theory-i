\begin{problem}{Massive real vector field}{p2}
   Consider a real vector field \(V_\mu\) with mass \(M_V\) whose Lagrangian is
   \begin{equation*}
      \mathcal{L} = - \frac14 V_{\mu \nu} V^{\mu\nu} + \frac12 M_V^2 V^\mu V_\mu,
   \end{equation*}
   with \(V_{\mu\nu} = \partial_\mu V_\nu - \partial_\nu V_\mu.\)
   \begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
       \item Obtain the classical equations of motion of this system and show that \(\partial_\mu V^\mu = 0.\)
       \item Canonically quantize this system.
       \item Obtain the Feynman propagator for this field.
   \end{enumerate}
