\begin{problem}{Gauge invariance in classical electromagnetism}{p1}
   Consider a classical system whose Lagrangian density is 
   \begin{equation*}
      \mathcal{L} = - \frac14 F_{\mu \nu}F^{\mu\nu} - J^\mu A_\mu,
   \end{equation*}
   where \(F_{\mu \nu} = \partial_\mu A_\nu - \partial_\nu A_\mu.\) What is the condition for this system to be invariant under a gauge transformation?
