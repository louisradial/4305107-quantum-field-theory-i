\begin{problem}{Free Proca field}{p2}
   Consider a real vector field \(V_\mu\) with mass \(M\) whose Lagrangian is
   \begin{equation*}
      \mathcal{L} = - \frac14 F_{\mu \nu} F^{\mu\nu} + \frac12 M^2 V^\mu V_\mu,
   \end{equation*}
   with \(F_{\mu\nu} = \partial_\mu V_\nu - \partial_\nu V_\mu.\)
   \begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
       \item Obtain the classical equations of motion of this system and show that \(\partial_\mu V^\mu = 0.\)
       \item Canonically quantize this system.
   \item Obtain the Feynman propagator for this field.
   \end{enumerate}
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}[Solution]
   We have shown in \href{https://github.com/louisradial/4305107-quantum-field-theory-i/releases/tag/pset1}{Problem Set I} that
   \begin{equation*}
      \diffp{\mathcal{L}}{(\partial_\mu V_\nu)} = -F^{\mu \nu},
   \end{equation*}
   then we have
   \begin{equation*}
      \diffp{\mathcal{L}}{V_\nu} = \partial_\mu \left[\diffp{\mathcal{L}}{(\partial_\mu V_\nu)}\right] \implies \partial_\mu F^{\mu\nu} = - M^2 V^\nu
   \end{equation*}
   as the classical equation of motion. We consider \(G^{\mu\nu} = \frac12 \epsilon^{\mu \nu \rho \sigma} F_{\rho \sigma},\) then we also have
   \begin{equation*}
      \partial_\mu G^{\mu\nu} = \frac12 \partial_\mu \epsilon^{\mu \nu \rho \sigma} F_{\rho \sigma} = \frac12  \epsilon^{\mu\nu \rho \sigma} \left(\partial_\mu\partial_{\rho}V_{\sigma} - \partial_\mu \partial_{\sigma} V_{\rho}\right) = 0,
   \end{equation*}
   as we contract the antisymmetric indices of \(\epsilon^{\mu\nu \rho \sigma}\) with the symmetric tensors \(\partial_\mu \partial_\rho\) and \(\partial_\mu \partial_\sigma.\) On shell we have
   \begin{equation*}
      \partial_\nu V^\nu = -\frac{1}{M^2}\partial_\nu \partial_\mu F^{\mu\nu} = 0,
   \end{equation*}
   as we have done in \cref{prob:p1}.
\end{proof}
