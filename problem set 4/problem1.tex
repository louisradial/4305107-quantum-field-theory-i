\begin{problem}{}{p1}
   The helicity operator is defined as
   \begin{equation*}
      h = \frac{\vetor{\Sigma}\cdot \vetor{p}}{\norm{\vetor{p}}}.
   \end{equation*}
   \begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
       \item Show that his operator can be diagonalized simultaneously with the free Dirac Hamiltonian (\(H_D\)).
       \item Obtain the positive and negative energy eigenstates of \(h\) and \(H_D\).
   \end{enumerate}
\end{problem}
